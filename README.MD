## Hello there

I don't really know how u got here, but I will try to show a little bit about myself for you.

## Public information

My name is Daniel Reis. I currently live in São Paulo, Brazil and my work is to solve bugs at I9XP Technology. 

On my free time, I manage the @he4rtdevs community, which is basically a place where beginners search for people who wants to help new developers to find a direction of "know how" to code.

Nowadays I decided to focus on my TwitchTV channel and make entertainment with coding stuffs and build random projects while I try to teach something of these steps of "know how" to my viewers.
